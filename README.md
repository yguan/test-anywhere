# Test Anywhere

Test Anywhere is a test runner that you can inject to any website to run JavaScript tests. It is a showcase of how script injection can be used for end-to-end UI automation tests. It aims to show people that it is easier to write JavaScript tests that interact with the browser directly than writing WebDriver tests that go through layers before instrumenting the browser to do the actions.

## Demo

It's hosted [here](http://yguan.github.io/repos/test-anywhere/).

## UI Interaction

[![](http://yguan.github.io/img/projects/test-anywhere.png)](http://yguan.github.io/repos/test-anywhere/)

Move your mouse over the test runner on the right side and click the `Run Test` button to see it in action. You can also write code in the editor and run it against your browser.

## Script Injection

If you want to inject the [Ace Editor](http://ace.c9.io/) along with the [mocha](http://visionmedia.github.io/mocha/) test framework a non-https website, do the following steps:
* navigate to a website that you want to inject the test runner
* copy the code from [script-injector.js](https://github.com/yguan/test-anywhere/blob/master/app/js/script-injector.js)
* paste the script into the browser console to run it

Note: if you are hosting the test runner, set variable `baseUrl` to the right url.

## Development

#### Overview of Folder Structure

`app` Contains the source code for the Website
- `css` CSS files used by the site, but they are generated by the .less files in the `less` folder
- `less` [less](http://lesscss.org/) files for generating CSS files
- `img`  Images
- `js` JavaScripts files and template files
  - `lib` Libraries
  - `views` Controllers and view partials

#### require.js Config

* [app-config.js](https://github.com/yguan/test-anywhere/blob/master/app/js/app-config.js) is the require.js config used in development.
* [app-config-dist.js](https://github.com/yguan/test-anywhere/blob/master/app/js/app-config-dist.js) is used the build. It specifies the absolute url for `ace.js` and `ext-language_tools.js` so that when injecting the script, Ace Editor will load correctly.

#### Grunt Configuration

All the grunt config and options are located in the `tasks` folder.

## Build

To build the package, you have to have `node.js` installed, then in command line console, run the followings steps once:

- go to `test-anywhere` folder
- (if grunt-cli is not installed) run `npm install -g grunt-cli`
- run `npm install`

Now, you can build your project with running `grunt build`. The output folder is `dist`, you can change it in the `config` variable of `Gruntfile.js`.

## Less Files Compilation

`grunt build` compiles all less files to app-min.css. In development, you can run `grunt watch`, and all less files will be compiled in 2 seconds after you change a less file. You can change the delay period `debounceDelay` in `tasks/options/watch.js`.

## Run the Website locally

If you have [python](http://www.python.org/download/) installed, run the following steps in the command line console:

- go to `app` folder
- run `python -m http.server` (you can specify port number at the end as well, default is 8000)
- go to your browser, and type in the `localhost:8000` to the address bar
- you should see the site running in the browser
