# Windows 8 Style Dashboard

This repository contains the source code of a Windows 8 style dashboard built with AngularJS, bootstrap, gridster, and angular-carousel.

## Demo

It's hosted [here](http://yguan.github.io/repos/dashboard/).

## UI Interaction

### Manipulate the cards
* <b>Resize Card:</b> Move the cursor to a card's right, bottom, or right bottom corner, and then drag to resize
* <b>Move Card:</b> Click and drag the card

### Add more slides
* Click the plus sign icon on the left
* Type in the number of cards
* Click the save button

### Move slides
* Use left/right arrow key
* Use mouse click on the top/bottom area (not on cards) and drag to left/right

### For Touch Devices

It seems to be working for Android Jelly Bean. To move the card, touch, and hold for a brief moment, then move the card. To resize, just touch the bottom right corner and move. To move slide, touch and move.

## Development

#### Overview of Folder Structure

`app` Contains the source code for the Website
- `css` CSS files used by the site, but they are generated by the .less files in the `less` folder
- `less` [less](http://lesscss.org/) files for generating CSS files
- `img`  Images
- `js` JavaScripts files and template files
  - `data` Data used by the charts or views
  - `extension` Extensions for libraries in the `lib` folder
  - `lib` Libraries
  - `views` Controllers and view partials

## Grunt Configuration

Based on Thomas Boyt's[`More maintainable Gruntfiles](http://www.thomasboyt.com/2013/09/01/maintainable-grunt.html), I split the Gruntfile.js into files under `tasks` folder. I think it's more maintainable.

## Build

To build the package, you have to have `node.js` installed, then in command line console, run the followings steps once:

- go to `portfolio-site` folder
- (if grunt-cli is not installed) run `npm install -g grunt-cli`
- run `npm install`

Now, you can build your project with running `grunt build`. The output folder is `dist`, you can change it in the `config` variable of `Gruntfile.js`.

## Less Files Compilation

`grunt build` compiles all less files to app-min.css. In development, you can run `grunt watch`, and all less files will be compiled in 2 seconds after you change a less file. You can change the delay period `debounceDelay` in `tasks/options/watch.js`.

## Run the Website locally

If you have [python](http://www.python.org/download/) installed, run the following steps in the command line console:

- go to `app` folder
- run `python -m http.server` (you can specify port number at the end as well, default is 8000)
- go to your browser, and type in the `localhost:8000` to the address bar
- you should see the site running in the browser
